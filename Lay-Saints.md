I want a moratorium on the saint making process for men who had received Holy Orders for 100 years.

No Servant of God, no Blessed, no Venerable, no Saint, unless they are laity.

The road to sainthood is paved with gold, as they say. So much work needs to done, testimony and writings gathered, witnesses interviewed, and all that data synthesized. Many hours of researcher's labor must be paid.

And so we see popes, bishops, priests, and religious at the front of the line.

It's a subtle form of clericalism we can do without.

As a remedy, a century of only lay saints would be a good start.

But even after that, maybe we could run sainthood causes through a ratio filter. Take the ratio of living laity to clergy and religious, and use that ratio to determine how many of each get canonized.

For sake of argument, say it's 100 to 1. Then, 100 lay saints must be canonized, before 1 clerical or religious saint.

Just to give an example of how far off we are from a real life ratio, Pope Francis has canonized 68 saints during his pontificate, only 8 were laity, the rest religious or clergy. We aren't even close to a 1 to 1 ratio of laity to religious/clergy.

100 years, no religious or clerical saints. It will do us all a lot of good.
